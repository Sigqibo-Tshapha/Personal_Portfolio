This is my personal portfolio page.

I will try to update it whenever I remember to, but it does not necessarily represent my full abilities as a developer.

Any work that requires computation will not be deployed here because Git (to my current understanding), only allows static web pages for free tie. Paying for a personal portfolio domain just does not make sense atm.
