        <div class="content">
            <p>
                My interest in computers started in high school doing CAT, where we built our annual projects using HTML
                 and CSS and had to learn the standard MS office suite. It all caught my fancy so I started fixing phones 
                 and resurrecting old PC's, so I guess thats where the passion started.
            </p>
            <p>
                I decided to study computer science because I knew my interest would always lead me to software engineering anyway so I figured might as well do it now. 
                In our first year we were introduced to Python, which felt almost natural but unfortunately my journey with it was cut short.  
            </p>
            <p>
                We went on to learn Java, which felt slightly more complex and more powerful, teaching us core concepts like OOP, data structures and just thinking logically.
                The university's java projects were fairly straight forward, focused more on critical thinking and computer science fundamentals, 
                but more recently I took a keen interest in developing GUI games/applications in Java and finished my version of the old snake game, which taught me a lot about the 
                graphics library and modelling object state,after that I am currently working on writing the tetris game.
            </p>
            <p>
                I started learning PHP in conjunction with mySQL, HTML and CSS for our second year project. It was of our first big project and honestly very frustrating, 
                it taught us a lot about never-seen-but-important hardwork, teamwork, accountability and being able to perform to high standards even under pressure. We started learning how to
                put the industry standards into practice,following the SDLC using Scrum methodology.We built a website for our  university's soccer team to publish their events, sell merchendise and tickets and
                manage their club.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was actively involved in our final year project, which we started off by first understanding the client(Powerlux Electricals), what they did and their expectations 
of the systems we were to develop(a business automation system that enabled them to manage their inventory, perform transactions,manage agents etc.). Fortunately they 
had no pre-existing business management systems so we were starting things from scratch. We did most of our project planning, sytem analyis and design within the first
half of the semester, the client was happy and our team had a detailed plan to follow. We then proceeded with programming and actually building the front-end system 
using C# in VS2015, this is when we started to familiarize with tools like GitHub for sharing and managing work.
            </p>

            <p>
                We finalised the system in second semester by building them an ecommerce website tailored to their brand, with a few additional functionalities that enabled the manager
to keep track of the business operations remotely. We made use of ASP.NET and mySQL to build our web application, notably making use of Crystal Reports and for BI and ensuring
rigorous testing to ensure our system met high demand.
            </p>
            <p>
I also had another final year project where we utilised C++ to develop the Abalone board game, the objective of which was to better understand modular programming,the C++
STL and own Library creation. Part of that same learning curve was learning about Unix, it process synchronization, scheduling and networking.
            </p>
            <p>
                My last and most challenging final year learning curve was artificial intelligence, where we looked well to Search-based AI,Prolog and Neural Networks. This is where 
I also had to go back to python, learn more on version control and ty to understand complex concepts in a language I had considered relatively easy.
            </p>
            <p>
                In conclusion, my working experience with as a developer has just begun, but my journey with th industry is extensive. Mentioned above are just the technical and real-work
environments I have been involven in,but I carry more in studies and understanding of not only code, but also industry practices and hope to continue growing and becoming a
better developer over time.
            </p>
